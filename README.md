# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

Your task is to write a sentiment analysis program for movie reviews. The program will use a corpus of movie reviews to train and will be able to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative.

The movie reviews that you will use are from a classic paper by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee, A Sentimental Education: Sentiment Analysis Using Subjectivity Summarization Based on Minimum Cuts. The dataset is available at: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/review_polarity.tar.gz.
- You can use the sklearn.datasets.load_files function to load the data after you have downloaded and unzipped them.
- Use at least two different classification methods (at the end you will pick the best).
- Find a good set of parameters using grid search.
- Evaluate the performance on a held out test set.
- A very simplistic skeleton of the solution is at: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/doc/tutorial/text_analytics/solutions/exercise_02_sentiment.py

Your assignment will be in English. It must be well-written and self-contained, so that an executive could understand your analysis with minimum knowledge of the tools that you use.  

Go for it!
